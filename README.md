# Learning-Azure-Devops
Learning Strategy


## Learning objectives
 - In this course, you will learn the core values and practices of DevOps, how to become an effective change agent in your organization, and the best practices to rapidly deliver high-quality software. You will learn the foundational elements of DevOps:

   - Implementing __Infrastructure as Code (IaC)__ and __configuration as code (CoC).__
   - Building and deploying automatically to production often and consistently.
   - Testing automatically before and during production
   - Tracking production to align with suitable metrics to improve business results
   - The labs in this course provide you with opportunities to practice implementing a DevOps pipeline by using Microsoft Azure and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).
## Lab steps
> Detailed labs steps in the course are provided via two GitHub pages sites:

## PartsUnlimited and PartsUnlimited MRP
Some labs in this course will use a sample application to provide a real-world experience. The sample application consists of two parts:

 > PartsUnlimited (PU): a .NET Core 2.0 application that is used for labs based on Microsoft products.

 > PartsUnlimted Manufacturing Resource Planning (PUMRP): The application uses entirely open-source software including Linux, Java, Apache, and MongoDB, which creates a web front end, an order service, and an integration service.

> Parts Unlimited and PartsUnlimited MRP are fictional applications used purely for training purposes and are based on the description in chapters 31-35 of The Phoenix Project by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford. (© 2013 IT Revolution Press LLC, Portland, OR.) Resemblance to “Project Unicorn” in the novel is intentional; resemblance to any real company is purely coincidental.

The sample applications can be downloaded from the GitHub pages, and you will be directed at various stages in the lab steps to download and use the relevant sample application.
