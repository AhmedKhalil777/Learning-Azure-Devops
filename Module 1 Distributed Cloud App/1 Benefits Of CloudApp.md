# Benefits of Cloud Computing
- Cloud computing is a big shift from the traditional way that businesses think about IT resources.
## Why is cloud computing so popular?
>  Here are six common reasons why organizations are turning to cloud computing services:

- Cost.
 >  Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software, then setting up and running on-site datacenters—the racks of servers, the round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, and the IT experts for managing the infrastructure. It adds up fast.

- Speed.
 >  Most cloud computing services are provided self-service and on demand, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks. This gives businesses flexibility and takes the pressure off capacity planning.

- Global scale.
 >  The benefits of cloud computing services include the ability to scale elastically. In cloud speak, that means delivering the right amount of IT resources—for example, more or less computing power, storage, and bandwidth—right when it's needed, and from the right geographic location.

 - Productivity.
 >  Onsite datacenters typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”—hardware setup, software updating, and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, so IT teams can spend time on more important business goals.

- Performance.
>  The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters that are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, including reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale.

 -  Reliability.
 >  Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive, because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.

Although cloud computing offers a number of benefits, building applications for the cloud requires a different approach.
